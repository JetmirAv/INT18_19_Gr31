             <p>Walking and cycling as transport modes
               Of all journeys, 20-40% are travelled by cycle or on foot,
               with the highest percentage in the Netherlands and the
               lowest in Finland. 
               Trips on foot take place most frequently in Great Britain, 
               whereas bicycle trips are most frequent in the Netherlands,
               Denmark and Sweden.
             </p>
                
                <p>(te see more)Walking as a transport mode
                   Walking as a means of transport is commonly used 
                   for rather short trips. This means 
                   that it is actually difficult to assess pedestrian 
                   mobility at country level, as the national 
                   travel surveys often do not register the shorter trips.
                   Also, the walking parts of trips made primarily
                   by public transport are usually not taken into account.
                   At present,
                   the importance of walking is therefore underestimated
                </p>
                
                <p>(te see more )Cycling as a transport mode
                 In most countries, a high proportion of people
                 own a bicycle (in Norway,
                 for instance, 70% of 
                 adults own a bicycle, in Switzerland, 69% 
                 of households own a bicycle). The number of bicycles per 1 000 
                 inhabitants ranges from 52 in the Czech
                 Republic to 1 000 in the Netherlands. 
                 What differs considerably from 
                 one country to another is the way in 
                 which the bicycle is used. Some cyclists 
                 use it every day, as a means of 
                 transport, while others do so only occasionally.
                </p>
                
                <p>(te see more)The bicycle is used for short
                    trips to shops and for leisure purposes
                    where the bicycle-tour probably is an aim 
                    in itself. However, cycling is also a common 
                    way for travelling to work [28]. Between 
                    about 30 and 40% of the person kilometres by 
                    bicycle is travelled on home-work trips.
                    Home-leisure trips cover about 20-45% of the
                    person kilometres, with the most made 
                    in Switzerland and the least in Finland.

                  <p>Bus travel between Europe‚Äôs big cities can be
                      a cheap way of getting from A to B, but it‚Äôs rarely 
                      the quickest way to travel and is often subject
                      to last-minute delays and cancellations. 
                      Trains are a fast, comfortable alternative
                      to budget bus travel,
                      and with a Eurail Pass you can even enjoy
                      unlimited travel across Europe using just
                      one ticket at a fixed price.

                  <p>(te see more Busi)A bus ticket will take you from
                      A to B, but if you want to go any further you‚Äôll
                      have to book each leg of your journey separately.
                      This can be risky, as unpredictable delays caused
                      by traffic on the roads can mean missing your 
                      connection, costing you a lot more.
                      If you want to visit smaller towns on your trip
                      as well as the big cities, you‚Äôll find yourself
                      having to 
                      make long stopovers due to limited services or 
                      figure out the rest of the journey yourself.

                  <p>(te see more treni)Whether you‚Äôre travelling to big
                      cities or small villages, 
                      with a Eurail Pass you just book one ticket to cover
                      all your travel, plus a few seat reservations
                      depending on where you want to travel.
                      What‚Äôs more, your Pass gives you total flexibility;
                      just turn up and jump on whichever trains suit your
                      plans.
                      It doesn‚Äôt matter if you miss your train ‚Äì you can
                      just hop on the next one!

                    <p>The one recurring feature of a long backpacking 
                        stint (aside from dirty laundry and malnutrition) 
                        is public bloody transport. As any traveler can
                        testify when you get the option of taking any 
                        other mode of transport rather than another long 
                        distance bus,
                        you grab it with both hands. When that mode of 
                        transport is a boat, you‚Äôre in for a real treat‚Ä¶
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>(see more)Possibly the best aspect to traveling
                        by boat, certainly for a backpacker, is the 
                        social side. 
                        You‚Äôre stuck on this vessel for a long-time
                        with a finite group
                        of people to converse with, before too long
                        you‚Äôll be swapping stories like old friends.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>(see more)Don‚Äôt even bother trying to tell me 
                        you didn‚Äôt dream about sailing boats as a kid,
                        following in the footsteps Christopher Columbus
                        or Vasco De Gama or chasing pirates in the high
                        seas. This lets you (discreetly!) relive your
                        childhood dreams in the most traditional long
                        distance transport available. Land Ahoy!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Some may argue that this is a negative aspect
                        but I beg to differ. Boats are not lightning fast,
                        far from it but this is another aspect I enjoy.
                        You meander across an ocean or down a river at 
                        a leisurely pace, 
                        giving you time to genuinely appreciate the
                        journey that you‚Äôre on. You can plan your next
                        steps with
                        all the free time you find yourself with and 
                        kick back, read a book and sanctimoniously 
                        think of all
                        the people around the world darting to and 
                        fro in
                        their fast-paced jobs while you, unhurriedly,
                        enjoy the rolling of the water.
